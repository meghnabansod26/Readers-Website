      <p>Once, someone asked Warren Buffet what the secret of his considerable net worth was. Then pointing to the bookshelf behind him, he said that I read around 500 pages daily. He believes that the Compounding of knowledge is greater than the compounding of money.   </p>
      <p>Warren Buffet is not the only one who gives importance to reading. Founder of Angelist, and the guy who gave funding to startups like Twitter and Uber at an early stage. Angel Investors Naval Ravikant was asked what the effective ways to build a new mental model are.</p> 
      <p>Then he said a single sentence, ” Read A Lot”. he could’ve suggested watching movies, documentaries, and YouTube videos. </p>
      <p>But he gave importance to only reading. Because, at first, every new idea of a person gets landed on paper after releasing it from the mind, and only then can it be presented in the form of movies, videos, and documentaries. </p>
      <p>He says I’m among the top 1% of people worldwide. Because I read books for 1-2 hrs. daily, many think we don’t need to read books because we quickly get summaries on YouTube. </p>
      <p >Because in documentaries or videos, many things get mixed, and to make it more entertaining, they add something on their own, but reading books will give you the actual message that a book wants to convey.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
    <p>I think that the benefits that book reading gives you are phenomenal. It is an integral part of our lives. Just like our bodies need exercise to stay healthy, our minds need to be challenged and exercised regularly. Every aspect of our lives is essential and should be taken care of. 

      The foundation for all our progress today is built on the knowledge found within the pages of books.</p>
    <p>So it’s safe to say reading is one activity you must learn to do to get a head start in life. 

    </p>
    <p>Even if you are not naturally inclined, make every effort to grow this habit. Most of the world’s most outstanding leaders and successful business people have a large appetite for books. </p>

    <p>It’s reported that Bill Gates reads as many as 50 books in a year. Warren Buffets reads five newspapers and over 500 pages of reports daily. And Mark Zuckerberg reads a book every 2 weeks. So who knows? Reading could just be the secret pass to the billionaire club. </p>
